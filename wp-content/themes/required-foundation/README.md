We would like to thank [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and [ZURB](http://zurb.com) for constantly pushing the boundaries and creating awesome stuff we all benefit from. required+ Foundation wouldn't be possible without all the fantastic people out there. required+ Foundation is under GPL, except for the parts from Foundation which are licensed under MIT, so yes it's free to use. Go and build something new!
