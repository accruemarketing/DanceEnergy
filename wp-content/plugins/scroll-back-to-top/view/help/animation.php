<h2>Animation Options</h2>

<h3>Scroll Duration</h3>
This setting determines how long it takes for the page to scroll to the top.  Values here are in milliseconds.
Note that 500-100 is recommended for the best results, but you can enter any value you like here.

<h3>Visibility Duration</h3>
This setting is the time the button will be shown after the user scrolls down the page.  The default value of
0 means that the option is disabled and the button will not time out.  A value greater then 0 milliseconds will
cause the button to timeout after the set amount of time has passed.  If you choose to use this option I recommend
a value between 1500ms-2500ms.

<h3>Fade Duration</h3>
This setting will change how fast the button fades in and out of the screen after the scrolling threshold is
reached.  Values here are in milliseconds.  Note that 500-100 is recommended for the best results, but you can
enter any value you like here.
