<h2>Button Location</h2>

<h3>Horizontal Alignment</h3>
This setting will change where the button appears from left to right.
<ul>
  <li>Left</li>
  <li>Center</li>
  <li>Right</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vertical Alignment</h3>
This setting will change whether the button appears on the top or bottom.
<ul>
  <li>Top</li>
  <li>Bottom</li>
</ul>

<h3>Horizontal Distance from Edge</h3>
This setting is how far away from the left or right side the button is positioned.
If the horizontal alignment is right then this setting will be the margin to the right side of the screen,
vice-versa if horizontal alignment is left.  If the horizontal alignment is set to 'center' then this setting
has no effect.  This value is in pixels.  Hint: if you want to dock the button to the side of the screen then
enter a 0 for this value.

<h3>Vertical Distance from Edge</h3>
This setting is how far away from the top or bottom the button is positioned.  If the vertical alignment is top
then this setting will be the margin to the top of the screen, vice-versa if vertical alignment is bottom.
This value is in pixels.  Hint: if you want to dock the button to the top or bottom of the screen then enter
a 0 for this value.
