Add custom links and other custom fields to WordPress Gallery images.

== Description ==

This plugin is intended for WordPress developers who want to create image galleries and require a few additional fields not provided by Media Library.

Please note that this plugin isn't suitable for non-developers. To use custom fields you need to build your own custom plugin.

Media Library Custom Fields is used by our free plugin [Grid Gallery with Custom Links](http://abcfolio.com/help/grid-gallery-with-custom-links/)
and premium plugin [Grid Gallery with Custom Links Pro](http://abcfolio.com/help/wordpress-plugin-grid-gallery-with-custom-links-pro/).

Full documentation at [http://abcfolio.com/help/wordpress-media-library-custom-fields/](http://abcfolio.com/help/wordpress-media-library-custom-fields/).
